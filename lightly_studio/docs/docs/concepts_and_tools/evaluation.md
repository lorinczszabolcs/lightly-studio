# Model Evaluation

Model evaluation runs let you compare model predictions against ground truth
[annotations](annotations.md) and surface per-sample quality metrics in LightlyStudio. Supported
task types are object detection, classification and semantic segmentation.

For a hands-on, end-to-end walkthrough, follow the
[Evaluate YOLO26 on Your Dataset](../tutorials/yolo26-model-evaluation.md) tutorial.

## Model Evaluation in the GUI

Evaluation results are accessible in the **Evaluation** panel of the GUI once a run has been created via the [Python API](#model-evaluation-in-python). Select an evaluation run in the **Evaluation** panel to inspect its configuration and confusion matrix. Then use the sample grid to drill into the underlying samples:

- Sort by `fp`, `fn`, or `tp` for object detection runs.
- Sort by `disagreement` for classification runs.
- Sort by `miou` for semantic segmentation.
- Filter to the affected classes and inspect the hardest samples in detail view.

!!! hint "Reading the confusion matrix"

    - Color intensity reflects the number of samples in each cell.
    - **Green diagonal cells** — the model predicts that class correctly.
    - **Red off-diagonal cells** — the model is confusing those two classes.
    - Use the red cells to decide which samples to inspect next in the grid.

## Model Evaluation in Python

### Creating an evaluation run

An evaluation run requires two annotation sources: one holding ground truth labels and one
holding model predictions. Use `dataset.evaluate()` to get the evaluation facade and then call the
task-specific method. Both return an [`EvaluationResult`](../api/evaluation.md#evaluationresult)
summary.

=== "Object detection"

    ```python
    import lightly_studio as ls
    from lightly_studio.evaluation.image_dataset_evaluate import ObjectDetectionEvaluationConfig

    IMAGES_PATH = "path/to/your/images/"
    GROUND_TRUTH_JSON = "path/to/your/GT_annotations.json"
    PREDICTIONS_JSON = "path/to/your/pred_annotations.json"
    
    dataset = ls.ImageDataset.create()
    dataset.add_images_from_path(path=IMAGES_PATH)
    # Add ground truth annotations
    dataset.add_annotations_from_coco(
        annotations_json=GROUND_TRUTH_JSON,
        images_root=IMAGES_PATH,
        annotation_source="ground_truth",
    )
    # Add prediction annotations
    dataset.add_annotations_from_coco(
        annotations_json=PREDICTIONS_JSON,
        images_root=IMAGES_PATH,
        annotation_source="predictions",
    )

    config = ObjectDetectionEvaluationConfig(
        iou_threshold=0.5,  # minimum IoU to count a detection as a true positive
        classwise=True,     # match predictions only within the same annotation class
    )

    dataset.evaluate().object_detection(
        name="my-od-eval",
        gt_annotation_source="ground_truth",
        pred_annotation_source="predictions",
        config=config,
    )

    ls.start_gui()

    ```

    Matching between predicted and ground truth boxes is based on intersection over union (IoU).
    The `iou_threshold` in the configuration defines the minimum IoU required for a prediction and
    a ground truth box to count as a match. Matched pairs contribute to true positives (`tp`),
    while unmatched predictions and unmatched ground truth boxes contribute to false positives
    (`fp`) and false negatives (`fn`).

    The `classwise` setting controls whether matching is restricted to boxes with the same class
    label. With `classwise=True`, a predicted `dog` box can only match a ground truth `dog` box.
    Disable `classwise` if you want cross-class matches to populate the confusion matrix
    off-diagonal, for example when a predicted `dog` is matched against a ground truth `cat`.

    The resulting per-sample metrics are stored as `tp`, `fp`, and `fn`, which means you can sort
    samples by the total number of true positives, false positives, or false negatives.

=== "Classification"

    ```python
    dataset.evaluate().classification(
        name="my-cls-eval",
        gt_annotation_source="ground_truth",
        pred_annotation_source="predictions",
    )

    ```

    Classification evaluation populates the confusion matrix directly from the ground truth and
    predicted labels.

    Per-sample metric stored: `disagreement` in `[0, 1]`. It is calculated as `1 - confidence`
    when the labels match, and as `confidence` when the labels do not match. Higher values
    indicate stronger disagreement between the ground truth and the prediction.

    You can sort samples by `disagreement` to inspect the most uncertain correct predictions or the
    most confident wrong predictions first.

=== "Semantic Segmentation"

    ```python
    dataset.evaluate().semantic_segmentation(
        name="my-semseg-eval",
        gt_annotation_source="ground_truth",
        pred_annotation_source="predictions",
    )

    ```

    Semantic segmentation evaluation populates the confusion matrix from the per-pixel ground truth
    and predicted class labels.

    Per-sample metric stored: `miou` (mean Intersection over Union). It is computed per image by
    calculating the IoU for each class present in either the ground truth or the prediction, then
    averaging those values across all classes. Higher values indicate better pixel-level agreement
    between the ground truth mask and the predicted mask.

    You can sort samples by `miou` to surface the images with the worst segmentation quality first.

### Evaluating a subset of samples

Pass a [`DatasetQuery`](../api/dataset_query.md) to `evaluate()` to restrict the run to a specific
set of samples — for example, a tagged validation split:

```python
from lightly_studio.core.dataset_query import ImageSampleField

val_query = dataset.query().match(ImageSampleField.tags.contains("val"))

result = dataset.evaluate(query=val_query).object_detection(
    name="val-eval",
    gt_annotation_source="ground_truth",
    pred_annotation_source="predictions",
)
```

Only samples that appear in both annotation sources **and** in the query are included. Samples
missing from either source are silently skipped.

### Reading evaluation results

`evaluate()` also reads back the runs that were already stored. This lets a script assert model
quality without the GUI.

Use `list_runs()` to get the stored runs, newest first. Each run is an
[`EvaluationRunView`](../api/evaluation.md#evaluationrunview) with its id, name, configuration,
creation time, and source names. Use `confusion_matrix()` to get the confusion matrix of a run by
its id.

```python
evaluator = dataset.evaluate()

runs = evaluator.list_runs()
for run in runs:
    print(run.name, run.created_at, run.evaluation_run_configuration)

matrix = evaluator.confusion_matrix(run_id=runs[0].id)
print(matrix.row_labels, matrix.col_labels, matrix.counts)
```

`confusion_matrix()` supports object-detection and classification runs. It does not support
segmentation runs.

See [Evaluation API Reference](../api/evaluation.md) for the full API surface.
