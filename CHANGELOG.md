# Changelog

All notable changes to Lightly**Studio** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Report anonymous usage data on app launch. Set `LIGHTLY_STUDIO_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false` to opt out.
- Sort the annotations grid by a per-annotation evaluation metric, such as IoU.
- Python SDK: Order video queries by `VideoSampleField.created_at`.
- Python SDK: Continue sampling from an existing tagged selection with the
  `preselected_tag_name` parameter.
- Python SDK: Select video-frame sequences with `selected_sequence_length` on `Sampling.diverse()`. It defaults to `None`, which selects individual frames. `n_samples_to_select` still counts frames and must be a multiple of the sequence length.
- Compare the annotation class distribution of any sample tag against the current view in the Distribution panel.
- Python SDK: Read stored evaluation runs and their confusion matrix with `dataset.evaluate().list_runs()` and `dataset.evaluate().confusion_matrix(run_id)`.
- Python SDK: Read aggregate evaluation metrics (per-class and micro-averaged precision, recall, and F1, plus classification accuracy) with `dataset.evaluate().metrics()`.

### Changed

- Stepping to the previous or next image now drives an index range scan instead of scanning the
  sort index from the start. On PostgreSQL with 1M images, one neighbour lookup went from 92ms
  to 0.03ms.
- Python SDK: `ImageDataset.add_images_from_path` now accepts `tag_depth > 1` to tag images by several leading directory levels (previously only `tag_depth=1` was supported).

- Stepping to the previous or next annotation in the annotation details view no longer sorts the
  whole collection on every click, for annotations on images and on video frames. On PostgreSQL
  with 4M annotations a click went from 6.3s to 1.3s; the neighbour lookup itself went from ~6s
  to 3ms, and the remaining 1.2s is the exact position and total counts.

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

- Fix requests failing intermittently while the GUI is under load, caused by concurrent access to a shared database session.
- Hide every bounding box and its annotation counts when all annotation sources are unchecked, instead of showing them all.

### Security

- Scope export downloads to the collection they were prepared for, so an export key from one collection can no longer be used to download an export prepared for a different collection.

## \[1.0.5\] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- Show indexed categorical metadata values in distribution panel.
- Add the `lightly-studio quickstart` CLI command, which downloads the COCO example dataset and launches the GUI in one step. Pass `--no-browser` to skip opening the browser.
- Export image and video classification annotations to CSV via the GUI and Python SDK.
- Python SDK: Export video frames as image files via `VideoFrameDataset.export().to_image_files()` with support for PNG, JPEG, WEBP, BMP, and TIFF formats. Returns the paths of the created files.
- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is supported in the LightlyStudio Enterprise version.
- Python SDK: Connect to LightlyStudio Enterprise with a long-lived API key by passing `api_key` to `lightly_studio.connect()` or setting `LIGHTLY_STUDIO_API_KEY`.
- Python SDK: Add support for table parameters in plugins, allowing users to pass multiple rows of input.

### Changed

- Show a busy indicator on save/delete/export/execute buttons while their action is running (caption, tag, operator, evaluation, and export actions).

### Removed

- The ignored `is_numeric` field on sort expressions in the images-list and adjacent-samples
  request bodies. Requests that still send it keep working; it is dropped during validation.
- The `cast_to_float` argument of `OrderByMetadataField`. Top-level numeric fields are now
  detected automatically, so `OrderByMetadataField("score", cast_to_float=True)` becomes
  `OrderByMetadataField("score")`. Nested fields (e.g. `stats.score`) now always sort
  lexicographically.

### Fixed

- Left and right arrow keys no longer navigate between samples while editing text or using an open
  dialog, menu, or listbox.
- Sorting by a numeric metadata field now orders numerically (e.g. `9` before `10`) without
  the caller declaring the field type.
- Tagging by embedding region now correctly limits samples to the selected area.
- Export downloads are no longer blocked by popup blockers.
- Grid annotation overlays now render at tile resolution to bound memory usage for large source images.
- Annotation class names no longer overflow in class selection.
- Autofocus lets users create their first annotation faster.
- Opening a DuckDB database that another lightly_studio process already has open now raises a clear error instead of a raw DuckDB traceback.
- Coloring the 2D embedding plot by annotations or metadata now loads faster, especially for large datasets.
- Changing annotation colors is now smoother and shows a live preview while dragging the color picker.
- Hover previews in the annotations embedding plot now show the relevant image crop and annotation overlay, matching the annotations grid.
- Custom annotation color opacity is now applied to segmentation masks in the detail view. Contributed by @sam-watts.

## \[1.0.4\] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- Python SDK: Allow embedding video frames by adding the `embed_frames` parameter to `VideoDataset.add_videos_from_path` and `VideoDataset.add_videos_from_youtube_vis`.
- Python dataset queries can now filter annotation evaluation results for false positives and false negatives.
- Show numeric metadata values in distribution panel.
- Add a selector for the numeric metadata histogram bin count.
- Introduce button to see expanded distribution for numeric metadata values.
- Add metadata filter chips to the left sidebar
- Display classification annotations in the annotations grid.
- Show a preview image when hovering over the 2d embedding plot.

### Changed

- The left filter panel can now be collapsed entirely to reclaim space for the grid; a "Filters" button in the grid header restores it.
- Image and video opening paths (indexing and embedding) now handle errors consistently: broken files are tolerated and skipped instead of breaking the whole operation.

### Fixed

- Class distribution bar chart: tooltip was clipped when hovering a chart with a single class.
- Long tags shown in the left side menu are truncated.

## \[1.0.3\] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Python SDK: `limit` parameter on `ImageDataset.add_samples_from*` methods to index only the first N samples of a dataset.
- Python dataset queries now support model evaluation queries on the annotation level.
- View class distribution for image classification.
- Custom embedding models can be registered.

### Changed

- Embedding plot legend is now compact and scrollable, and the WebGPU fallback message is no longer shown.

## \[1.0.2\] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- Annotation classes can now be shown or hidden individually in the grid views using an eye icon toggle in the Annotation Classes sidebar.
- Python SDK: `target_fps` parameter on `VideoDataset.add_videos_from_path` to subsample frames to a
  lower frame rate. Retained frames keep their original frame numbers.
- Sampling in Browser now supports combining multiple strategies (diversity, typicality, similarity, metadata weighting, class balancing) in a single selection.
- Sampling dialog now accepts a percentage input alongside the absolute sample count. Editing either field updates the other based on the current    
filtered sample count.
- Deduplication strategy is available in the Sampling Dialog in the GUI
- Improve confusion matrix usability for large numbers of classes
- Python dataset queries now support classifications, object detections, and segmentation mask annotations.
- Python dataset queries now model evaluation queries on the sample level.
- Improved performance when tagging all samples in the GUI for large datasets.
- Annotation source selection for exports: when multiple annotation collections exist, the export dialog shows a dropdown to choose which collection to export from. The annotation source can also be specified via the Python API using the `annotation_collection_id` parameter.
- All embedding plot legend entries (especially e.g. `Excluded by filters`, `No category`, etc.) can be hidden by clicking on them.
- YOLO object detection export: object detection annotations can now be exported in YOLO format from the GUI export dialog, via the Python API (`dataset.export().to_yolo_object_detections(...)`), and via the export API (`export_format=object_detection_yolo`).
- Object-level (annotation) embeddings: annotations can now be embedded and searched by text or image similarity and visualized in the embedding plot.

## \[1.0.1\] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- Show plugin description and a link to documentation when no plugins are available.
- When sorting the image grid by a numeric field, the field value is now shown as an overlay on each sample.
- Query editor now supports annotation `source` and `confidence` fields in queries.
- Panel toggles (Embeddings, Query, Evaluation) moved to a right-rail icon menu beside the collection grid.
- Python SDK: `annotation_source` parameter on `ImageDataset.add_samples_from*` methods and
  `Sample.add_annotation` / `add_annotations` to import or add annotations to a named source.
- Python SDK: `Annotation.annotation_source` property to read the annotation source name.
- Python SDK: `Sampling.deduplicate` method to select a deduplicated subset based on embedding distance.

### Changed

- The embedding plot legend now reflects the active filter: categories with no
  matching samples are hidden. When there are more values than fit in the
  legend, the least frequent values are merged into a single "Other" category.

### Fixed

- Fixed embedding rendering for users without WebGPU by updating `embedding-atlas` from `0.10.0` to `0.21.0`.
- The query filter is now applied consistently across features that use the image filter, such as the embedding plot, sampling, and select-all.
- Brush tool's `Finish` button gives better visual feedback when an annotation can be finished.

## \[1.0.0\] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Show confusion matrix in evaluation results for classification.

### Changed

- Header menu: show collection name in Annotations entries
- Embedding plot coloring now supports multiple categories per sample, resolving issues with toggling visibility of categories in the legend.
- Made annotation and plot colors more distinguishable.
- General UI improvements.

### Fixed

- Embedding plot: when a coloring has more categories than the legend can display, the extra
  categories are now grouped into an "Other" entry instead of exceeding the available legend slots.
- Grid top bar no longer overflows its container or covers the grid when a side panel is open;
  it now shrinks with the available width and wraps onto a second line when too narrow.
- Fixed operations on large datasets (more than ~65,535 samples) failing on PostgreSQL with
  `number of parameters must be between 0 and 65535`.
- Fixed cascaded delete for annotations linked by calculated metrics.
- Grid annotation source selection now persists when navigating to image details and back.

## \[1.0.0rc1\] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Sample selection respects the current image or video filters.
- Added sort-by support via GUI.
- Added similarity selection option.
- Show confusion matrix in evaluation results for object detection.
- Added option to select annotation source for class balancing.
- Added query editor for advanced filtering with custom queries.
- Added Model Evaluation:
    - Users can manage annotations from different sources, e.g. ground truth and predictions.
    - Users can evaluate per sample metrics for object detection, classification and semantic segmentation
    - Users can sort the image grid by the sample metrics: finding errors quickly.
    - Users can display confusion matrix to find error patterns.

### Changed

- Renamed the `collection_name` and `name` arguments to `annotation_source`. Breaking change.
- Renamed selection to sampling. Breaking change.

### Fixed

- Fixed hovering over breadcrumb links on detail pages (annotations, video frames) triggering unwanted navigation.

## \[0.4.14\] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Added `ImageDataset.add_annotations_from_coco`, `add_annotations_from_yolo`, and `add_annotations_from_labelformat` methods to attach annotations to images already in the dataset. Re-using the same `annotation_source` appends; a new `annotation_source` creates a new annotation source. Enables ingesting ground truth and predictions from multiple sources side-by-side.
- Added `lt_train_script` to the Python API (`lightly_studio.lt_train_script`) to generate a LightlyTrain object detection script from split tags. The helper exports train/val COCO annotation files via `dataset.export(...).to_coco_object_detections(...)` and writes `train_object_detection.py` with the exported paths.
- Image samples can be sorted in the grid using image attributes and metadata.
- Added drag-and-drop from the image grid into the image search area.
- Added a select-all button to select all grid items matching the active filters.
- Added `Cmd+A` / `Ctrl+A` keyboard shortcut to select all samples matching the current filters in grid views (images, videos, video frames, annotations).
- Added API endpoints to fetch only sample IDs with optional filters for images, video frames, and annotations (used by the select-all keyboard shortcut).


### Changed

- Refactored annotation mask rendering to use a shared web worker pool instead of spawning one worker per canvas.
- Few-shot classifier predictions now land in an annotation collection named after the classifier instead of the generic `annotation` collection, so multi-prediction views can distinguish classifiers. Rerunning a classifier reuses the same collection.
- Removed the license key requirement for sampling.


## \[0.4.13\] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- Added a floating selection panel to grid pages.
- Tags can be created and assigned directly from the sample and annotation detail view.
